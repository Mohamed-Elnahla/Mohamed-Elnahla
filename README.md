## About Me

👋 Hello! I am Mohamed Mohsen Elnahla, a Civil Engineering professional with a passion for construction management and BIM development. Currently pursuing my Master of Science (MS) degree in Construction Management, I have a strong background in engineering and a keen interest in leveraging technology to optimize construction processes.

## Education

🎓 Bachelor of Engineering (BE) in Civil Engineering

## Work Experience
👨‍💻 BIM Software Developer (BIM Development Engineer) at Research and Development Department, Redcon Construction

In my role as a BIM Software Developer at Redcon Construction's Research and Development Department, I have gained valuable experience in BIM development and worked extensively with various Autodesk platforms and services. Some of the key areas I specialize in include:

💻 APS (Autodesk Platform Services) - Forge  
💻 Revit API  
💻 Navisworks API  
💻 AutoCAD API  
💻 Dynamo  
💻 PowerBI Custom Visuals  
💻 PowerBI Custom Connectors  
💻 Chrome Extensions  
💻 Node.js  
💻 Python scripts  
💻 VBA in Excel  


My work primarily involves leveraging these technologies to develop innovative solutions that optimize construction processes and enhance collaboration within project teams. I have successfully implemented BIM workflows, developed automation scripts, and created custom visualizations to improve efficiency and streamline construction management tasks.

I have also actively contributed to Redcon Construction's research and development initiatives, working closely with cross-functional teams to explore new technologies and drive continuous improvement in BIM practices.

Feel free to explore my GitHub repositories to see examples of my work and the projects I have contributed to.

## Projects

Throughout my career, I have contributed to several projects that involve the implementation of BIM technology and automation. Some notable projects include:

🚧 [BIM-Based Automatic Schedule Generation In Primavera P6](link-to-project-1): creating a full schedule in Primavera P6 automatically based on a Revit Model.

🚧 [Autodesk APS Viewer - Forge Viewer in PowerBI](link-to-project-2): viewing and interacting with Revit's 3D models inside PowerBI, also filtering visuals based on selected elements.

🚧 [APS - Forge Models Data connector in PowerBI](link-to-project-3): exporting model data as PowerBI tables and automatically reflecting any updates.

🚧 [ACC ToolKit - Chrome Extension](link-to-project-3): improving Autodesk Build features in Forms and Submittals by adding an Auto Numbering System based on the Naming convention and the type of Form.

🚧 [1D Cutting Optimization](link-to-project-3): a set of algorithms to detect the best cutting of 1D parts out of 1D stock elements (Solving Stock Cutting Optimization Problems).

🚧 [Excel To Revit](link-to-project-3): creating Families, Levels, and Placing Elements based on a set of Excel Files.

🚧 [Revit Data Extractor](link-to-project-3): exporting Revit Model Data in the form of an Excel Table with all Project and element data.

🚧 [4D Automatching in Revit](link-to-project-3): assigning Activity ID in a custom parameter automatically to each Revit Element based on an Excel File.

🚧 [Schedule Crashing Using Genetic Algorithm](link-to-project-3): crashing Schedule using Genetic Algorithm (GA).
